      <h1>LIMITAIONS TO THE YUMMY CREAM PROJECT</h1>
      <h2>
        1. Firstly, seasonal problems much like weather concerns somewhere with
        warm weather year-round, mobile ice cream shops can open during the
        warmer season.
      </h2>
      <h2>
        2. Frequent vehicle maintenance Unlike a physical building, mobile ice
        cream shops need regular vehicle maintenance. With constant movement and
        weather concerns you'll need to continually keep up your shop. It'll
        take more work than a traditional shop.
